I'm Jianwei Hou, Ph.D. candidate(2016-now) at Renmin University of China, School of Information. I am supervised by Prof. Wenchang Shi. I was also supervised by Dr. Yinzhi Cao when I studied at Johns Hopkins University, Department of Computer Science from 2019-2021. 

<br><br>
My research interests lie in IoT security and privacy, SDN security and vulnerabilities detection. I used to work on revealing specific security threats in SDN and exploring accuracy and efficiency of vulnerabilities detection. And now I am working on how to audit and detect sensitive Information disclosure in IoT devices. I also interested in human–computer interaction in cybersecurity. Human factors plays important part in all the security issues.

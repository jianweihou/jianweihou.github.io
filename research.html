<strong><a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/w82vfneoeyvmhe5/Capital_Controls_Corporate_Debt_Real_Effects.pdf?dl=0"> Capital Controls, Corporate Debt and Real Effects</a></strong><br>with Andrea Fabiani, Martha L&oacute;pez Pi&ntilde;eros and Jos&eacute;-Luis Peydr&oacute;<br>
<p style="text-align:justify"><b><i>Abstract: </i></b>Non-US firms have massively borrowed dollars (foreign currency, FX), leading to booms and crises. We show the real effects of capital controls, including benefits, through a firm-debt mechanism. For identification, we exploit a tax on FX-debt inflows in Colombia before the global financial crisis (GFC), and administrative, proprietary datasets, including credit register data and FX-debt inflows. Capital controls substantially reduce FX-debt inflows (larger for more-exposed-FX firms). Moreover, firms with weaker local banking relationships cannot substitute FX-debt with domestic-debt, thereby reducing imports. However, capital controls improve exports during the GFC –by preemptively reducing pre-crisis firm-level debt–, especially for financially-constrained firms.</p><br>
